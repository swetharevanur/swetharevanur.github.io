			Data is a curious beast. I focus on taming and harnessing it to solve interdisciplinary problems. I just wrapped up my undergrad in <b>computer science at Stanford University</b> (a year early!), and am looking for full-time roles starting in January 2020. I have an extensive background taking <b>machine learning</b> projects from ideation to execution. Check out some articles I've penned on <a href="https://medium.com/@swetharevanur" target="_blank">Medium</a> and various code samples on <a href="https://github.com/swetharevanur" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
